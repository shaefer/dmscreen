				<p>You attract followers to your cause and a companion to join you on your adventures.</p>
				<p><b>Prerequisite</b>: Character level 7th.</p>
				<p><b>Benefits</b>: This feat enables you to attract a loyal cohort and a number of devoted subordinates who assist you. A cohort is generally an NPC with class levels, while followers are typically lower level NPCs. See Table: Leadership for what level of cohort and how many followers you can recruit.</p>

				<p><b>Leadership Modifiers</b>: Several factors can affect your Leadership score, causing it to vary from the base score (character level + <a linkindex="707" href="gettingStarted.html#charisma-new">Cha</a> modifier). Your reputation (from the point of view of the cohort or follower you are trying to attract) raises or lowers your Leadership score:</p><table>

<tbody>
<tr class="odd"><td>Great renown</td><td>+2</td></tr>
<tr class="even"><td>Fairness and generosity</td><td>+1</td></tr>

<tr class="odd"><td>Special power</td><td>+1</td></tr>
<tr class="even"><td>Failure</td><td>–1</td></tr>
<tr class="odd"><td>Aloofness</td><td>–1</td></tr>
<tr class="even"><td>Cruelty</td><td>–2</td></tr></tbody></table>

				<p>Other modifiers may apply when you try to attract a cohort, as listed below.</p><thfoot></thfoot><table>
<thead><tr><th>The Leader... </th><th>Modifier</th></tr></thead>

<tbody><tr class="odd"><td>Has a familiar, special mount, or animal companion</td><td>–2</td></tr>
<tr class="even"><td>Recruits a cohort of a different alignment</td><td>–1</td></tr>
<tr class="odd"><td>Caused the death of a cohort</td><td>–2*</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2">* Cumulative per cohort killed.</td></tr></tbody></table>

				<p>Followers have different priorities from cohorts. When you try to attract a follower, use the following modifiers.</p><table>
<thead><tr><th>The Leader... </th><th>Modifier</th></tr></thead>

<tbody><tr class="odd"><td>Has a stronghold, base of operations, guildhouse, etc.</td><td>+2</td></tr>
<tr class="even"><td>Moves around a lot</td><td>–1</td></tr>
<tr class="odd"><td>Caused the death of other followers</td><td>–1</td></tr></tbody></table>

				<p><i>Leadership Score</i>: Your base Leadership score equals your level plus your <a linkindex="708" href="gettingStarted.html#charisma-new">Charisma</a> modifier. In order to take into account negative <a linkindex="709" href="gettingStarted.html#charisma-new">Charisma</a> modifiers, this table allows for very low Leadership scores, but you must still be 7th level or higher in order to gain the Leadership feat. Outside factors can affect your Leadership score, as detailed above.</p>

				<p><i>Cohort Level</i>: You can attract a cohort of up to this level. Regardless of your Leadership score, you can only recruit a cohort who is two or more levels lower than yourself. The cohort should be equipped with gear appropriate for its level (see <a linkindex="710" href="creatingNPCs.html">Creating NPCs</a>). A cohort can be of any race or class. The cohort's alignment may not be opposed to your alignment on either the law/chaos or good/evil axis, and you take a –1 penalty to your Leadership score if you recruit a cohort of an alignment different from your own.</p>
				<p>A cohort does not count as a party member when determining the party's XP. Instead, divide the cohort's level by your level. Multiply this result by the total XP awarded to you, then add that number of experience points to the cohort's total.</p>
				<p>If a cohort gains enough XP to bring it to a level one lower than your level, the cohort does not gain the new level—its new XP total is 1 less than the amount needed to attain the next level. </p>
				<p><i>Number of Followers by Level</i>: You can lead up to the indicated number of characters of each level. Followers are similar to cohorts, except they're generally low-level NPCs. Because they're usually 5 or more levels behind you, they're rarely effective in combat.</p>
				<p>Followers don't earn experience and thus don't gain levels. When you gain a new level, consult Table: Leadership to determine if you acquire more followers, some of whom may be higher level than the existing followers. Don't consult the table to see if your cohort gains levels, however, because cohorts earn experience on their own.</p>

				<p><b>Benefit</b>: You can choose to take a –1 penalty on all melee attack rolls and combat maneuver checks to gain a +2 bonus on all melee damage rolls. This bonus to damage is increased by half (+50%) if you are making an attack with a two-handed weapon, a one handed weapon using two hands, or a primary natural weapon that adds 1-1/2 times your Strength modifier on damage rolls. This bonus to damage is halved (–50%) if you are making an attack with an off-hand weapon or secondary natural weapon.

				<h2 id="quicken-spell">Quicken Spell (Metamagic)</h2>
				<p>You can cast spells in a fraction of the normal time.</p>

				<p>A quickened spell uses up a spell slot four levels higher than the spell's actual level. Casting a quickened spell doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity.</p>

				<p><b>Normal</b>: A character without this feat needs a move action to reload a hand or light crossbow, or a full-round action to reload a heavy crossbow. </p>
				<p><b>Special</b>: You can gain Rapid Reload multiple times. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new type of crossbow.</p>

				<p><b>Prerequisite</b>: Base attack bonus +1.</p>
				<p><b>Benefit</b>: Whenever an adjacent foe attempts to take a 5-foot step away from you, you may also make a 5-foot step as an immediate action so long as you end up adjacent to the foe that triggered this ability. If you take this step, you cannot take a 5-foot step during your next turn. If you take an action to move during your next turn, subtract 5 feet from your total movement.</p>
				<h2 id="still-spell">Still Spell (Metamagic)</h2>
				<p>You can cast spells without moving.</p>

				<p><b>Benefit</b>: A stilled spell can be cast with no somatic components. Spells without somatic components are not affected. A stilled spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell's actual level.</p>

				<p><b>Benefit</b>: Whenever you score a critical hit, your opponent becomes <a linkindex="826" href="glossary.html#stunned">stunned</a> for 1d4 rounds. A successful <a linkindex="827" href="combat.html#fortitude">Fortitude</a> save reduces this to <a linkindex="828" href="glossary.html#staggered">staggered</a> for 1d4 rounds. The DC of this <a linkindex="829" href="combat.html#fortitude">Fortitude</a> save is equal to 10 + your base attack bonus. The effects of this feat do not stack. Additional hits instead add to the duration.</p>

				<p><b>Benefit</b>: You must declare that you are using this feat before you make your attack roll (thus, a failed attack roll ruins the attempt). Stunning Fist forces a foe damaged by your unarmed attack to make a <a linkindex="833" href="combat.html#fortitude">Fortitude</a> saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your <a linkindex="834" href="gettingStarted.html#wisdom">Wis</a> modifier), in addition to dealing damage normally. A defender who fails this saving throw is <a linkindex="835" href="glossary.html#stunned">stunned</a> for 1 round (until just before your next turn). A <a linkindex="836" href="glossary.html#stunned">stunned</a> character can't take actions, loses any <a linkindex="837" href="gettingStarted.html#dexterity">Dexterity</a> bonus to <a linkindex="838" href="combat.html#armor-class">AC</a>, and takes a –2 penalty to <a linkindex="839" href="combat.html#armor-class">AC</a>. You may attempt a stunning attack once per day for every four levels you have attained (but see Special), and no more than once per round. Constructs, oozes, plants, undead, <a linkindex="840" href="glossary.html#incorporeal">incorporeal</a> creatures, and creatures immune to critical hits cannot be <a linkindex="841" href="glossary.html#stunned">stunned</a>.</p>

				<p><b>Special</b>: A monk receives Stunning Fist as a bonus feat at 1st level, even if he does not meet the prerequisites.

				<p>Calling upon higher powers, you cause undead to flee from the might of your unleashed divine energy.</p>
				<p><b>Prerequisites</b>: Channel positive energy class feature.</p>
				<p><b>Benefit</b>: You can, as a standard action, use one of your uses of channel positive energy to cause all undead within 30 feet of you to flee, as if <a linkindex="850" href="glossary.html#panicked">panicked</a>. Undead receive a <a linkindex="851" href="combat.html#will">Will</a> save to negate the effect. The DC for this <a linkindex="852" href="combat.html#will">Will</a> save is equal to 10 + 1/2 your cleric level + your <a linkindex="853" href="gettingStarted.html#charisma-new">Charisma</a> modifier. Undead that fail their save flee for 1 minute. Intelligent undead receive a new saving throw each round to end the effect.
