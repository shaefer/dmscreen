This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
We then added in Redux
Using Redux we created basic usage of
- Action-Creators
  - Example of document level event handling that can dispatch actions.
- Combined Reducers
- react-grid-system layout example
